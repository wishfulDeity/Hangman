TODO
- Tell the time that it took for the user to solve the word

- Clear the terminal window on each turn to make it look cleaner

- Allow for spelling mistakes in guesses and have a 
  "Did you mean _____?" thing (no idea how I'd implement that)

- Allow the user to pick an amount of games they want the play
  i.e. literally just put the while loop in
  "for loop in range(games): while ... blah blah"

- Do something like guessed letters with guessed words where
  it tells you if you've guessed that word before

- Have a 'guessed words' area as well as the 'guessed letters area

- Add a difficulty setting where each 
  difficulty picks from less common words

- End the game if the word has been revealed fully
